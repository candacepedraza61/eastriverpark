<p> The East Coast Resiliency Project is an unprecedented development underway on the East Side of Manhattan. In several parks along the East Side, construction has already begun on a flood wall or other flood prevention projects. Lower Manhattan is a specific target of this construction as flooding has been a problem for this area since Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012 and since another large storm this past September. </p>

<p> 311 complaint data from Open Data NYC that shows the number of complaints called in over the last 11 years in the area of Manhattan getting flood prevention development. </p>

<p> However, several community organizations and  Councilperson-elect Christopher Marte are speaking out against plans to close East River Park until 2022 or later to get the project done. For them, it represents a broken promise from the City Council and Mayor’s office. </p>

<p>New York City’s Department for Design and Construction stated that the new plan brings the park itself into a “protected zone,” which is a big benefit to the community living near the East River in the face of rising water levels due to climate change.</p>
